# Degree Screener Project

### Problem Statement
In view of the problems that prospective university students in Singapore face when making such an important decision, our group has thus decided to tackle this issue in a data-driven approach. Our problem statement is as such - How to choose a degree and university in Singapore given the variety of factors at play in the decision-making process?

Based on the factors influencing a student’s choice of degree and university mentioned earlier, we have categorised these factors into quantitative and qualitative factors, where factors such as tuition fees and career opportunities are grouped as quantitative data and factors such as proximity and university social culture being grouped as qualitative factors. Career opportunities were broken down into more specific and quantifiable factors including employability, starting salary, wage increment within each industry, and job vacancy based on historical trends. In addition, our group has also included other two factors which we deem as relevant in the decision-making process - MBTI and cut-off point, which will indicate their suitability and eligibility.

By collecting the relevant data for all the factors needed in the decision-making process from different sources, we aim to bring all these data in one location and provide useful insights for the prospective students through different forms of data visualisation so that they can see at one glance the different degrees and universities based on both their suitability and preferences.

### Value Proposition
Through the identification of the factors influencing a prospective university student in the decision-making process and subsequently interrelating these factors during the data visualisation stage, it allows for students to make a more informed decision regarding the university degree that they want to pursue. More than simply being relevant for the prospective students personally, this would also be a valuable source of data for the university’s marketing department, as it allows for the identification of popular degrees among students and even the degree with the highest prospect in the job market. Such data are especially important for the university’s marketing department when there is a need to attract a pool of talents to their university.
